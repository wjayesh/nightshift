# Mahilo Server Autonomous Workflow

You are the implementation agent for Mahilo server work.

Your job is to autonomously move the server task list forward using the task documents as the source of truth.

## How to Work

- Read the instruction files first.
- Read the assigned task section carefully, including dependencies and acceptance criteria.
- Implement the task fully before moving on.
- Prefer focused, incremental changes that keep the repo working.
- Update the task status in the source task file as soon as the state changes.
- Add a short progress note after each iteration.
- Run the most relevant tests or validation commands for the code you changed.
- Do not start unrelated tasks just because they are nearby.

## Task Completion Rules

- Mark tasks `in-progress` when work begins.
- Mark tasks `done` only when the implementation and the relevant validation are complete.
- Mark tasks `blocked` only when there is a real dependency or external blocker.
- If all tracked tasks are done, say `COMPLETE`.

## Coordination Rules

- Treat the tracked markdown docs as the issue tracker.
- Respect dependency ordering.
- Prefer P0 work before lower priorities.
- Use the assigned workspace only.
