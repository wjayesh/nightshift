# Mahilo Autonomous Orchestrator

Mahilo now uses an in-repo autonomous development loop inspired by Symphony, but backed by markdown task lists instead of Linear.

## Goals

- keep task tracking in-repo
- dispatch one ready task at a time
- keep agent work focused on a single task
- support persistent progress and repeatable runs
- isolate task work with native git worktrees when desired
- keep `main` clean by reconciling into an integration branch

## Source of Truth

- `WORKFLOW.md` is the default **server** workflow
- `WORKFLOW.plugin.md` is the separate plugin workflow
- `docs/prd-server-policy-platform.md` is the current server task source
- `docs/prd-openclaw-plugin-migration.md` is the current plugin task source
- `docs/openclaw-plugin-server-contract.md` is the shared server/plugin contract

## How It Works

1. Load a workflow file.
2. Parse task docs for task IDs, statuses, priorities, and dependencies.
3. Optionally parse separate dependency sources to gate tasks on external prerequisites.
4. Pick the next ready task.
5. Create or reuse a task-specific git worktree branch.
6. Run `codex exec` with the workflow prompt plus the assigned task section.
7. Leave in-progress changes inside the task branch worktree until the task reaches a terminal state.
8. When a task reaches `done` or `blocked`, commit that work in the task branch.
9. Acquire a short repo-level lock only for integration-branch mutation.
10. Cherry-pick the new task-branch commit(s) into the shared integration branch.
11. Auto-push after every configured commit threshold, and on final completion.
12. After every configured batch of completed tasks, run a review pass against the last batch and let the reviewer add high-priority remediation tasks when needed.
13. Re-read the task docs on the integration branch to see whether the task moved to `done`, `blocked`, or remains active.
14. Repeat until all tracked tasks are complete or the loop limit is reached.

## Files

- `src/orchestrator.ts` — parser, scheduler, dependency resolver, git-worktree manager, git integration helpers, and agent runner
- `scripts/orchestrator.ts` — CLI entrypoint and runtime loop
- `scripts/ralph.sh` — compatibility wrapper that now calls the new orchestrator
- `.mahilo-orchestrator/state.json` — persisted server runtime state
- `.mahilo-orchestrator/progress.md` — server iteration log
- `.mahilo-orchestrator/plugin-state.json` — persisted plugin runtime state
- `.mahilo-orchestrator/plugin-progress.md` — plugin iteration log

## Safety and Git Behavior

- Workflows are branch-guarded and currently require `autonomous/server-integration`.
- The loop reconciles into the integration branch, never directly into `main`.
- Each completed or blocked terminal task is committed in its own task branch before integration.
- The integration branch stays linear by cherry-picking task commits instead of merging task branches.
- The loop auto-pushes after every 3 integrated task commits by default.
- Concurrent workflows share a repo-level lock only around cherry-pick and push operations.
- The plugin workflow is scoped away from server implementation files to reduce overlap.

## Commands

```bash
bun run scripts/orchestrator.ts
bun run scripts/orchestrator.ts --once
bun run scripts/orchestrator.ts --once --dry-run
bun run scripts/orchestrator.ts --workflow WORKFLOW.plugin.md --once --dry-run
./scripts/ralph.sh
```

## Current Limitations

- Task parsing expects the current PRD format with `ID`, `Status`, `Priority`, and `Depends on` metadata lines.
- The orchestrator uses one active task at a time per workflow.
- Worktree cleanup is manual for now.
- The loop does not yet manage multiple parallel agents within a single workflow.
